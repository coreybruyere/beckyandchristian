# Song 1

On the day
\
That you were born
\
All the family
\
Was next door
\
And your mom
\
Was to explode
\
Becky is coming
\
Hurry up
\
\
You grew up
\
In LA town
\
You're a gringa
\
All around
\
And you dream
\
To live so long
\
With your loving Mr. Wrong
\
\
[CHORUS]
\
We all want to
\
Marry a millionaire
\
Marry a millionaire (2)
\
We all want to
\
Marry a millionaire
\
Marry a millionaire (2)
\
\
You work hard
\
For every penny
\
Don't forget
\
You will be many
\
At the end
\
You are not alone
\
There is forever
\
Mr. Wrong
\
\
[CHORUS]
\
\
All I want
\
Is wish you well
\
I know honey
\
Ring the bell
\
All your dreams
\
Will be fulfilled
\
Ain't no limit
\
Please believe
\
\
[CHORUS]

# Song 2

Thursday evening all with a luck
\
Beck and Christian will tie the knot
\
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day
\
\
They love surfing over thhe waves
\
They hike mountains and fish on the lakes
\
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day!
\
\
They met when life was a joy ride
\
They were young carefree high school sweethearts
\
It was for prom that Christian wrote on the street
\
Will you be my date, oh ma it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Camping, laughing always with friends
\
Nature lovers, sun, wine, or rain
\
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Skiing, diving, who knows what else
\
Always planning crazy affairs
\
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Chris-ti-an pick up your mess
\
I am tired of cleaning after you left
\
Gordita please don't yell, I am in the zone
\
Oh oh oh oh ma, ma, ma, ma it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Time goes by and we have great hope
\
Becky and Christian will grow to be more
\
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Growing older they will stay strong
\
Business savvy will stay afloat
\
Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Chris-ti-an pick up your mess
\
I am tired of cleaning after you left
\
Gordita please don't yell, I am in the zone
\
Oh oh oh oh ma, ma, ma, ma it's a beautiful day!
\
\
Oh oh oh ma, ma, ma, ma it's a beautiful day!
